CRYOSPHERIC INDICATORS,"A set of parameters that describe the changing climate with a focus on the cryosphere, which can include ice sheets, ice shelves, glaciers, snow cover, permafrost (frozen ground), sea ice, and river and lake ice. The cryosphere exerts an important influence on Earth’s climate, owing to its high surface reflectivity (albedo). This property gives it the ability to reflect a large fraction of solar radiation back into space and influences how much solar energy is absorbed by land and oceans. Ice on land, in the form of ice sheets and glaciers, plays a further important role in the Earth system through its ability to store vast amounts of water away from the oceans for long periods of time. Any change in the ice volume stored on land, as ice sheets and glaciers grow or shrink, has a direct impact on global mean sea level. As the climate changes, the cryosphere changes with it and, through feedback processes, these changes have an influence on the climate. For example, the increased melting of snow and ice caused by a warming planet enables more solar energy to be absorbed by land or water, which in turn leads to more warming. This is also known as the snow- or ice-albedo feedback.","Label: CRYOSPHERIC INDICATORS

For example, a character may be considered a desert adaptation because many desert-dwelling species possess the character, and non-desert-dwelling species do not. However, if there are many desert-dwelling species in a particular part of a clade, then this character may have evolved by chance alone.

VLBI (VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY),"Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) is a geometric technique: it measures the time difference between the arrival at two Earth-based antennas of a radio wavefront emitted by a distant quasar. Using large numbers of time difference measurements from many quasars observed with a global network of antennas, VLBI determines the inertial reference frame defined by the quasars and simultaneously the precise positions of the antennas. Because the time difference measurements are precise to a few picoseconds, VLBI determines the relative positions of the antennas to a few millimeters and the quasar positions to fractions of a milliarcsecond. Since the antennas are fixed to the Earth, their locations track the instantaneous orientation of the Earth in the inertial reference frame.The celestial reference frame is defined by VLBI. The International Astronomical Union has adopted over 3,400 extragalactic radio sources (mostly quasars) used by VLBI as the defining objects of the celestial reference frame. Extragalactic objects form a true inertial reference frame because they are at such great distances that their motions across the sky are undetectable. Positions of stars in our galaxy are now tied to this reference frame, and this is the same reference frame used for measuring Earth orientation. VLBI is unique in its ability to make rapid, accurate measurements of the orientation of the terrestrial reference frame with respect to the celestial reference frame.VLBI observations are sponsored by over 40 organizations located in 19 countries.

DISSOLVED CO2,"The carbon dioxide dissolved in water has even more effect than the oxygen. Oxygen remains as an O2 molecule, whether it's in its gas phase or in solution, but when CO2 is dissolved in water, a small proportion of it reacts chemically with H2O to form carbonic acid, H2CO3. (There's no mystery about that: just add up the six atoms.) In water carbonic acid dissociates rapidly to form a H+ ion and HCO2 (bicarbonate), so it affects the carbonate equilibrium, and pH values change as a result. Dissolved CO2 lowers the average pH of rainwater to 5.7, even where 'acid rain' caused by pollution isn't a factor. The gentle acidity of rainwater is a major source for the weathering of minerals, which the carbonic acid leaches from rocks and which eventually find their way to the ocean.","Label: DISSOLVED CO2

In the troposphere ammonia reacts rapidly with acids such as sulfuric (H2SO4), nitric (HNO3) to form fine particulate matter (PM2.5) [Malm et al., 2004]. These ammonium (NH4+) containing aerosols affect Earth's radiative balance, both directly by scattering incoming radiation [Adams et al., 2001; Martin et al., 2004; Henze et al., 2012] and indirectly as cloud condensation nuclei [Abbatt et al., 2006]. PM2.5 endangers public health by penetrating the human respiratory systems, depositing in the lungs and alveolar regions [Pope et al., 2002], and causing premature mortality [Lelieveld et al., 2015]. A precursor of these inorganic aerosols, gaseous NH3 is often the limiting species in their formation [Wang et al., 2013; Lelieveld et al., 2015]. Excess reactive nitrogen reduces biodiversity and causes harmful algal blooms and anoxic conditions. Dry deposition of gaseous ammonia may have substantially greater adverse impacts on ecosystem health than deposition of ammonium in aerosols or precipitation [Sheppard et al., 2011]. In contrast, PM2.5 has greater impact on human morbidity and mortality. In this article we quantify recent (~14 year) increases in tropospheric ammonia and suggest likely causes for these trends.","Label: AMMONIUM AEROSOLS

POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID,"Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) are major components of complex lipid molecules and are also involved in numerous critical biological processes. Studies conducted mainly in vertebrates have demonstrated that LC-PUFA can be biosynthesized through the concerted action of two sets of enzymes, namely fatty acyl desaturases (Fads) and elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (Elovl) proteins. While LC-PUFA research is a thriving field, mainly focused on human health, an integrated view regarding the evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthetic genetic machinery in chordates is yet to be produced. Particularly important is to understand whether lineage specific life history trajectories, as well as major biological transitions, or particular genomic processes such as genome duplications have impacted the evolution of LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathways. Here we review the gene repertoire of Fads and Elovl in chordate genomes and the diversity of substrate specificities acquired during evolution. We take advantage of the magnitude of genomic and functional data to show that combination duplication processes and functional plasticity have generated a wide diversity of physiological capacities in extant lineages. A clear evolutionary framework is provided, which will be instrumental for the full clarification of functional capacities between the various vertebrate groups","Label: POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID

Here we show both similarities and differences in the C:N:P ratios of primary producers (autotrophs) and invertebrate primary consumers (herbivores) across habitats. Terrestrial food webs are built on an extremely nutrient-poor autotroph base with C:P and C:N ratios higher than in lake particulate matter, although the N:P ratios are nearly identical. Terrestrial herbivores (insects) and their freshwater counterparts (zooplankton) are nutrient-rich and indistinguishable in C:N:P stoichiometry. In both lakes and terrestrial systems, herbivores should have low growth efficiencies (10–30%) when consuming autotrophs with typical carbon-to-nutrient ratios. These stoichiometric constraints on herbivore growth appear to be qualitatively similar and widespread in both environments.","Label: NUTRITIONAL CONSTRAINTS

EL NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO),"An irregular variation of ocean current that from January to March
flows off the west coast of South America, carrying warm,
low-salinity, nutrient-poor water to the south. It does not usually
extend farther than a few degrees south of the equator, but
occasionally it does penetrate beyond 12 degrees S, displacing the
relatively cold Peru Current. The effects of this phenomenon are
generally short-lived, and fishing is only slightly
disrupted. Occasionally (in 1891, 1925, 1941, 1957 - 58, 1965, 1972 -
73, 1976, and 1982 - 83), the effects are major and prolonged. Under
these conditions, sea surface temperatures rise along the coast of
Peru and in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean and may remain high
for more than a year, having disastrous effects on marine life and
fishing. Excessive rainfall and flooding occur in the normally dry
coastal area of western tropical South America during these
events. Some oceanographers and meteorologists consider only the
major, prolonged events as El Nino phenomena rather than the annually
occurring weaker and short-lived ones. The name was originally applied
to the latter events because of their occurrence at Christmas time.

Interacting parts of a single global system of climate
fluctuations. ENSO is the most prominent known source of interannual
variability in weather and climate around the world, though not all
areas are affected. The Southern Oscillation (SO) is a global-scale
seesaw in atmospheric pressure between Indonesia/North Australia, and
the southeast Pacific. In major warm events El Nino warming extends
over much of the tropical Pacific and becomes clearly linked to the SO
pattern. Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are
developing countries with economies that are largely dependent upon
their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food
supply, employment, and foreign exchange. New capabilities to predict
the onset of ENSO event can have a global impact. While ENSO is a
natural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or
frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important
concern.

This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.The reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a country’s development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience.

The laser stations are also used to measure one-way distance from the ground stations to remote optical receivers on space and for very accurate time-transfer. Laser ranging activities are organized under the ILRS.SLR is an accurate technique for determining the geocentric position of an Earth satellite, allowing for the precise calibration of radar altimeters and separation of long-term instrumentation drift from secular changes in ocean topography. SLR’s ability to measure the temporal variations in the Earth’s gravity field and to monitor motion of a global network of stations with respect to the geocenter, together with the capability to monitor vertical motion in an absolute system, makes it unique for modeling and evaluating long-term climate change."

For the case of a change in solar irradiance (i.e., 'solar forcing'), the radiative forcing is simply the change in the average amount of solar energy absorbed per square meter of the Earth's area. Since the cross-sectional area of the Earth exposed to the sun (πr2) is equal to 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth (4πr2), the solar input per unit area is one quarter the change in solar intensity. This must be multiplied by the fraction of incident sunlight that is absorbed, F=(1-R), where R is the reflectivity, or albedo, of the Earth, equal to approximately 0.7. Thus, the solar forcing is the change in the solar intensity divided by 4 and multiplied by 0.7.","Label: SOLAR FORCING

SAMOA INDEX,"Refers to an environmental vulnerability index for Samoa. Development of a vulnerability index for the environment which could be calculated on the scale of entire states for the purpose of ranking them and providing a single-figure expression of their relative environmental vulnerabilities. This work was done in response to a call made in the Barbados Plan of Action, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and an increasing awareness that small island developing states face disadvantages to their development associated with their remoteness, small size, dispersion, economic conditions, and limited natural resources. In the past vulnerability indices have been developed which describe the risks associated with economic and social conditions, climate change, sea-level rise, natural disasters and anthropogenic impacts. Most of these indices describe the vulnerability of human systems; there have been very limited attempts to describe effects on the environment. Human systems and the environment are dependent on one another so that risks to the environment of a state will eventually translate into risks to humans. This is the first attempt to construct an index that focuses on the vulnerability of the environment. An Environmental Vulnerability Index (the EVI) was constructed, based on a theoretical framework that identified three aspects of vulnerability: risks to the environment (natural and anthropogenic), the innate ability of the environment to cope with the risks (resilience) and ecosystem integrity (the health or condition of the environment as a result of past impacts). These three aspects correspond to three sub-indices, the REI, IRI and EDI, which are the Risk Exposure sub-Index, Intrinsic Resilience sub-Index and Environmental Degradation sub- Index respectively. The EVI was calculated as a weighted average of scores allocated in the range of 0-7 derived from a total of 57 indicators. A preliminary EVI was calculated for three countries, Australia, Fiji and Tuvalu. The preliminary EVI value for Tuvalu was the highest of the three countries indicating that its environment is the most vulnerable. The score obtained for Fiji was intermediate in value, and that for Australia was the lowest, though the difference between Fiji and Australia was relatively smaller than that between Fiji and Tuvalu. There were similar levels of risk in each of the countries, the most degradation in Australia and the least intrinsic resilience in Tuvalu. These results, though promising are only preliminary because the EVI requires refinement and there was insufficient time to collect all of the required data from all of the countries and because there were some inconsistencies in the quality of the data. We expect that each of these problems can be overcome. The EVI developed here will require further refinement before it becomes fully operational. The results show that it is possible to obtain a single figure measure of vulnerability and that data which were previously thought to be difficult to obtain can be obtained. The methodology selected in the computation of the index can produce results which could have operational usefulness for ranking countries according to their environmental vulnerabilities. It is envisaged that the EVI would be recalculated every 5 years to provide updates on the vulnerability status of countries. This index highlights the need for governments to upgrade their collection and collation of environmental statistics. In addition, the breakdown of results into meteorological, geological, anthropogenic, and other categories of risk highlights areas of concern for environmental action.","Label: SAMOA INDEX

This means that nine years out of ten a temperature as cold or colder than 32 degrees is expected to occur later than March 1 during the spring season. For the fall season, the probability level represents the chance of having a temperature as cold or colder earlier than the computed date. The freeze-free probability level indicates the chance of having a longer freeze-free period than the computed number of days. The methods used to compute the freeze probabilities come from two data distributions: a discrete freeze or no-freeze distribution, where a no-freeze annual season is one in which only one or no freeze occurs; and a continuous one of freeze dates for the years of freeze occurrence, where at least two distinct freeze dates occur in a year.","Label: FIRST FREEZE/FROST PROBABILITY

MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION,"In 1971 Roland Madden and Paul Julian stumbled upon a 40-50 day
oscillation when analyzing zonal wind anomalies in the tropical
Pacific. They used ten years of pressure records at Canton (at 2.8B0 S
in the Pacific) and upper level winds at Singapore.
The oscillation of surface and upper-level winds was remarkably clear
in Singapore. Until the early 1980's little attention was paid to this
oscillation, which became known as the Madden and Julian
Oscillation(MJO), and some scientists questioned its global
significance. Since the 1982-83 El Nino event, low-frequency
variations in the tropics, both on intra-annual (less than a year) and
inter-annual (more than a year) timescales, have received much more
attention, and the number of MJO-related publications grew rapidly.","Label: MADDEN-JULIAN OSCILLATION

Oscillation' (PDO) in 1996 while researching connections between
Alaska salmon production cycles and Pacific climate. PDO has since
been described as a long-lived El Nino-like pattern of Pacific
climate variability because the two climate oscillations have similar
spatial climate fingerprints, but very different temporal behavior.
Two main characteristics distinguish PDO from El Nino/ Southern
Oscillation (ENSO): first, 20th century PDO 'events' persisted for
20-to-30 years, while typical ENSO events persisted for 6 to 18
months; second, the climatic fingerprints of the PDO are most visible
in the North Pacific/North American sector, while secondary signatures
exist in the tropics - the opposite is true for ENSO.
Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles
in the past century: 'cool' PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and
again from 1947-1976 while'warm' PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946
and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Shoshiro Minobe; has
shown that 20th century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two
general periodicities, one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from
50-to-70 years.","Label: PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION

OXYGEN ISOTOPE ANALYSIS,"A method of determining patterns of climatic change over long periods using the ratio of the stable oxygen isotopes 18O to 16O as an indicator of the amount of water locked up in ice-sheets and thus of global temperature.

When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive. Using this data a series of at least eleven cycles of cooling and warming climatic conditions have been recognized in the northern hemisphere during the Pleistocene.","Label: OXYGEN ISOTOPE ANALYSIS

Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology. Microfossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain.

Analysis of the air contained in bubbles in the ice can reveal the palaeocomposition of the atmosphere, in particular CO2 variations. Volcanic eruptions leave identifiable ash layers.While it sounds simple to analyze, there are issues of ice compression, flow, and other factors that must be taken into consideration when doing reconstructions from such data.

STEAM FOG,"(Or sea smoke; also called arctic sea smoke, antarctic sea smoke, frost smoke, water smoke, sea mist, steam mist.) Fog formed when water vapor is added to air that is much colder than the vapor's source; most commonly, when very cold air drifts across relatively warm water.No matter what the nature of the vapor source (warm water, industrial combustion exhaust, exhaled breath), its equilibrium vapor pressure is greater than that corresponding to the colder air; thus, the water vapor, upon becoming mixed with and cooled by the cold air, rapidly condenses. It should be noted that this mechanism never allows the fog to actually reach the vapor source. Also, upon further mixing in sufficiently turbulent or convective flow (only a slight degree is needed), the fog particles evaporate at a more or less well defined upper limit of the fog. Note, also, that although advection of air is necessary to produce steam fog, it differs greatly from an advection fog in the usual sense, which is caused by warm, moist air moving over a cold surface. Steam fog is commonly observed over lakes and streams on cold autumn mornings as well as in polar regions. It is sometimes confused with ice fog, but its particles are entirely liquid. At temperatures below -29°C (-20°F), these may freeze into droxtals and create a type of ice fog that may be known as frost smoke.","Label: STEAM FOG

STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX,"The SPI was formulated by Tom Mckee, Nolan Doesken and John Kleist of
the Colorado Climate Center in 1993. The purpose is to assign a single
numeric value to the precipitation which can be compared across
regions with markedly different climates. Technically, the SPI is the
number of standard deviations that the observed value would deviate
from the long-term mean, for a normally distributed random
variable. Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a
transformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation
values follow a normal distribution.
The Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly
express the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet
conditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other
time scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to
decision-makers. Consequently, a separate SPI value is calculated for
a selection of time scales, covering the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

EAST ATLANTIC PATTERN,"The East Atlantic (EA) pattern is the second prominent mode of low-frequency variability over the North Atlantic, and appears as a leading mode in all months. The EA pattern is structurally similar to the NAO, and consists of a north-south dipole of anomaly centers spanning the North Atlantic from east to west. The anomaly centers of the EA pattern are displaced southeastward to the approximate nodal lines of the NAO pattern. For this reason, the EA pattern is often interpreted as a “southward shifted” NAO pattern. However, the lower-latitude center contains a strong subtropical link in association with modulations in the subtropical ridge intensity and location. This subtropical link makes the EA pattern distinct from its NAO counterpart. This EA pattern is similar to that shown in the Barnston and Livezey (1987) study, but is distinctly different from the EA pattern originally defined by Wallace and Gutzler (1981).The positive phase of the EA pattern is associated with above-average surface temperatures in Europe in all months, and with below-average temperatures over the southern U.S. during January-May and in the north-central U.S. during July-October. It is also associated with above-average precipitation over northern Europe and Scandinavia, and with below-average precipitation across southern Europe.The EA pattern exhibits very strong multi-decadal variability in the 1950-2004 record, with the negative phase prevailing during much of 1950-1976, and the positive phase occurring during much of 1977-2004. The positive phase of the EA pattern was particularly strong and persistent during 1997-2004, when 3-month running mean values routinely averaged 1.0-2.0 standard deviations above normal.","Label: EAST ATLANTIC PATTERN

SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.","Label: SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS

Even in Europe the prevailing west to northwest winds of summer have been called the 'European monsoon.' The primary cause is the much greater annual variation of temperature over large land areas compared with neighboring ocean surfaces, causing an excess of pressure over the continents in winter and a deficit in summer, but other factors such as the relief features of the land have a considerable effect. The monsoons are strongest on the southern and eastern sides of Asia, the largest landmass, but monsoons also occur on the coasts of tropical regions wherever the planetary circulation is not strong enough to inhibit them. They have been described in Spain, northern Australia, Africa except the Mediterranean, Texas, and the western coasts of the United States and Chile. In India the term is popularly applied chiefly to the southwest monsoon and, by extension, to the rains which it brings.","Label: MONSOON ONSET/INTENSITY

The pattern consists of one primary anomaly center over the Gulf of Alaska and a separate anomaly center of opposite sign over the Hudson Bay. A weaker area of anomalies having similar sign to the Gulf of Alaska anomaly extends across Mexico and the extreme southeastern United States.

Definition: The Tropical/ Northern Hemisphere pattern was first classified by Mo and Livezey (1986), and appears as a prominent mode from November-February. The pattern consists of one primary anomaly center over the Gulf of Alaska and a separate anomaly center of opposite sign over the Hudson Bay. A weaker area of anomalies having similar sign to the Gulf of Alaska anomaly extends across Mexico and the extreme southeastern United States. This pattern reflects large-scale changes in both the location and eastward extent of the Pacific jet stream, and also in the strength and position of the climatological mean Hudson Bay Low. Thus, the pattern significantly modulates the flow of marine air into North America, as well as the southward transport of cold Canadian air into the north-central United States."
