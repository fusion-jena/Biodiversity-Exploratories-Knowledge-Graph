Long-term experiment (6 years), excluding gastropods from epiphytic cryptogam communities on European beech and Norway spruce. We focus on the response of algae, bryophyte, fungus and lichen abundance as well as lichen and bryophyte species richness 6 years after the start of the experiment. 

Test of intermediate disturbance hypothesis by gastropod grazing in epiphytic cryptogam communities.


(Note: former name of the section was measurements/theory)","In April 2008, we selected two trees per plot, which were representative for other trees occurring in the particular plot in terms of tree species identity, height and diameter at breast height (DBH). On each tree we placed a vertical transect with each five 10cm × 10cm subplots in each direction of the tree trunk and permanently marked the area with a staple gun using corrosion-free aluminium staples. In April 2008, we recorded the percentage cover of all lichen and bryophyte species as well as the total cover of free living green algae in each subplot. Then, we excluded gastropods from one of these trees by applying a 10 cm broad barrier of slug-repellent paste (IRKA Schneckenabwehrpaste; R+M Gartenbedarf GbR) at tree base two times per year, once in March before the vegetation period began and gastropods started to be active and once in June. In April 2011 and 2014 we repeated vegetation records including estimations for cover and grazing damage per species, and also recorded the cover of bark colonizing fungus species.

The overall goal of this project STRUCTURE is to find correlation between gap variables calculated based on aerial image analysis for the whole EP and the biodiversity of understory plant species being present in each EP. The idea is that this floral biodiversity of each EP is the consequence of spatio-temporal succession processes that should be strongly dependent on the spatial structure and distribution of gaps because understory light is a major limiting resource in beech-dominated forests.

(Note: former name of the section was measurements/theory)","To account for fine-scale variation in canopy cover, soil or micro-topography, we randomly spread seven 10 m × 10 m subplots within each EP. During the summer season in 2008, percentage cover data of understory plants (graminoids, herbs, ferns, and low shrubs [typically, up to a max. height of ~1.5 m at maturity]) have been recorded in steps of 1% for species coverage of 1-10% and steps of 5% for species coverage of 10-100%. Thus, we followed the sampling system of the main botany project (H. Baumbach, pers. comm.), which, in contrast to Braun-Blanquet data, has the advantage that data are readily usable for conventional multivariate analysis (Podani 2006).

(Note: former name of the section was measurements/type)","Instruments: laser-based range finder (LEICA) and compass to record the position of each subplot

Procedure: cover values judged by eye",Only vascular understory plant species are shown that could be identified to the species level.All species data have been standardized. This was done by dividing the recorded cover value of each species through the sum of all species cover values of a subplot. Note that this sum of all species cover values was sometimes greater than the “total plant cover” recorded for each subplot because species can have overlapped in layers within the recorded plant height of 1.5 m.,Other,,no,yes,yes,no,"forest structure, plant species diversity, spatial heterogeneity",Structured data,Habitat structure,,,,Habitat structure,,,STRUCTURE,the structure of gaps is most important in our project,,,,

Pollen was collected either directly in the field, or from collected plants kept in vases until anthers had opened or pollen had accumulated in the flower. For each sample, pollen from 2-400 flowers was pooled. Each pollen sample was controlled for contaminations with non pollen particles under a binocular microscope in the laboratory and then the sample was frozen until it was prepared for analysis by storing it in the cabinet dryer over night at 30 °C.Free and protein-bound amino acids were measured separately with an ion exchange chromatograph (Biotronik, amino acid analyser LC 3000).'bgc:type : 'Data on qualitative and quantitative pollen amino acid composition will be presented in a table containing approximately 100 plant species collected in 2007.

The supernatant was filled into a new E-cup and evaporated at 100 °C. Afterwards the sample was re-dissolved in 200 µl of water, immediately cooled to room temperature in ice and centrifugated again (10 min.). Subsequently 100 µl of the supernant were mixed with 20 µl 12.5% sulphosalicylic acid and extracted 30 minutes in the refrigeretor before short mixing and centrifugation for another 10 minutes followed. 100 µl of the supernant and 100 µl sample rarefaction buffer was transfered into a new E-cup.

A ‘flower unit’ was defined as a unit of one or more flowers demanding insects to fly from one unit to another. Insects were caught with a dip net or with help of an exhauster. Only insects sitting directly in the centre of the flowers seeming to feed on pollen or nectar were caught. Insects sitting on the petals were not taken into consideration.

(Note: former name of the section was measurements/theory)","The table contains: interactions between insect and plant species; the table contains 11 columns: Plot.ID, plant species, date, sample number = No, order = insect order, family = insect family, species = insect species, female, male, unsexed = sex was not determined, Total = the sum of male, female and unsexed individuals.Plant and pollinator species and orders will vary across different networks. Independent flower data are collected before starting sampling (see: ""flower availability 2007 Schwäbische Alb""); abiotic environmental factors will be available in future.
